heks (work-in-progress)
===============================================================================

`heks` (**h**andler for **e**vents and **k**eyboard **s**hortcuts) aims to 
provide a unified interface between the buttons you press and corresponding 
actions by your computer. It was inspired by 
[sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd).

A mouse is often not efficient and a touchscreen can be unwieldy. Making 
gestures with your fingertips to make things happen can feel like performing a 
magical spell.

Despite that potential, in practice, keyboard shortcuts are not as fast and 
natural as they should be. They are often hard to remember and not consistent 
across applications. `heks` tries to address that.

heks (work-in-progress)
===============================================================================

`heks` (**h**andler for **e**vents and **k**eyboard **s**hortcuts) aims to 
provide a unified interface between the buttons you press and corresponding 
actions by your computer. It was inspired by 
[sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd). I also intend to borrow some 
ideas from [kmonad](https://github.com/david-janssen/kmonad), 
[xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape) and 
[caps2esc](https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/caps2esc).

A mouse is often inefficient and a touchscreen is imprecise and limiting. 
Consider, for contrast, the magic of making things happen simply by gesturing 
your fingertips across a keyboard.

Despite that potential, in practice, keyboard shortcuts are not as fast and 
natural as they should be. They are often hard to remember and not consistent 
across applications. To find out which buttons to press, do you check the 
manual pages? Use the `-h` switch? `--help`? Press the `F1` or `?`-key? 
Perhaps there's a guide in some information widget? On a website? And will you 
remember? Of course, this could be solved by simply using graphical 
applications instead, but `heks` tries to address without demanding the 
sacrifice of efficiency and simplicity.
